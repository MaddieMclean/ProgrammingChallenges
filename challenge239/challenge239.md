<p>Back in middle school, I had a peculiar way of dealing with super boring classes. I would take my handy pocket calculator and play a "Game of Threes". Here's how you play it:</p>

<p>First, you mash in a random large number to start with. Then, repeatedly do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the number is divisible by 3, divide it by 3.</li>
<li>If it's not, either add 1 or subtract 1 (to make it divisible by 3), then divide it by 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>The game stops when you reach "1". </p>

<p>While the game was originally a race against myself in order to hone quick math reflexes, it also poses an opportunity for some interesting programming challenges. Today, the challenge is to create a program that "plays" the Game of Threes.</p>

<h1>Challenge Description</h1>

<p>The input is a single number: the number at which the game starts. Write a program that plays the Threes game, and outputs a valid sequence of steps you need to take to get to 1. Each step should be output as the number you start at, followed by either -1 or 1 (if you are adding/subtracting 1 before dividing), or 0 (if you are just dividing). The last line should simply be 1.</p>

<p>The input is a single number: the number at which the game starts.</p>

<pre><code>100

<h1>Output Description</h1>

<p>The output is a list of valid steps that must be taken to play the game. Each step is represented by the number you start at, followed by either -1 or 1 (if you are adding/subtracting 1 before dividing), or 0 (if you are just dividing). The last line should simply be 1.</p>

<pre><code>100 -1
33 0
11 1
4 -1
1
